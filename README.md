I'm so happy you're joining me on this path. We'll be building immensely satisfying projects in the coming weeks. Some will be easy, some will be challenging, many will ASTOUND you! The projects build on each other so you develop deeper and deeper expertise each week. One thing's for sure: you're going to have a lot of fun along the way.

# Before you begin
I'm here to help you be most successful with your learning! If you hit any snafus, or if you have any ideas on how I can improve the course, please do reach out in the platform or by emailing me direct (maadabushi@gmail.com.com). It's always great to connect with people on LinkedIn to build up the community - you'll find me here:

# Instant Gratification instructions with Llama 3.2 not Llama 3.3!
## Important note: see my warning about Llama3.3 below - it's too large for home computers! Stick with llama3.2! Seome may miss this warning...
We will start the course by installing Ollama so you can see results immediately!

Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com noting that on a PC you might need to have administrator permissions for the install to work properly
On a PC, start a Command prompt / Powershell (Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter). On a Mac, start a Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
Run ollama run llama3.2 or for smaller machines try ollama run llama3.2:1b - please note steer clear of Meta's latest model llama3.3 because at 70B parameters that's way too large for most home computers!
If this doesn't work: you may need to run ollama serve in another Powershell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), and try step 3 again. On a PC, you may need to be running in an Admin instance of Powershell.
And if that doesn't work on your box, I've set up this on the cloud. This is on Google Colab, which will need you to have a Google account to sign in, but is free: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-_f5XZPsChvfU1sJ0QqCePtIuc55LSdu?usp=sharing
Any problems, please contact me!
